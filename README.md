You might be wondering: what is this gorgeous piece of art?
Well, it's the beautiful resource pack I made for the Twitch streamer [Juicesoar](https://twitch.tv/juicesoar).

It adds bell themed paintings, bell themed love particles, bell themed sounds and a fabulous payed actor themed creeper, called Dave (w.i.p.).
